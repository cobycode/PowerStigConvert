        Domain Admins group
        "Local account and member of Administrators group" or "Local account" (see Note below)

        All Systems:
        Guests group

        Systems dedicated to the management of Active Directory (AD admin platforms, see V-36436 in the Active Directory Domain STIG) are exempt from denying the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups.

        Note: Windows Server 2012 R2 added new built-in security groups, "Local account" and "Local account and member of Administrators group". "Local account" is more restrictive but may cause issues on servers such as systems that provide Failover Clustering.
        Microsoft Security Advisory Patch 2871997 adds the new security groups to Windows Server 2012.'
