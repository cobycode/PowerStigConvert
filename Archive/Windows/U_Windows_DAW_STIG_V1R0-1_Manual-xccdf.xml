      <title>Administrators of high-value IT resources must complete required training.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Required training helps to mitigate the risk of administrators not following required procedures. High-value IT resources are the most important and critical IT resources within an organization. They contain the most sensitive data in an organization, perform the most critical tasks of an organization, or have access to and can control all or nearly all IT resources within an organization. Requiring a DAW used exclusively for remote administrative management of designated high-value IT resources, including servers, workstations, directory services, applications, databases, and network components, will provide a separate "channel" for the performance of administrative tasks on high-value IT resources and isolate these functions from the majority of threats and attack vectors found on higher-risk standard client systems. A main security architectural construct of a DAW is to remove non-administrative applications and functions from the DAW. Technical controls for securing high-value IT resources will be ineffective if administrators are not aware of key security requirements.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The Authorizing Official (AO) must designate which IT resources are high value. The list must include the following IT resources:

- Directory service (including Active Directory)
- Cloud service
- Identity management service
- Privileged access management service
- Credential management service
- Security management service (anti-virus, network monitoring/scanning, IDS/IPS, etc.)
- Any sensitive business/mission service
- Any other IT resource designated as high value by the AO

Note: A high-value IT resource is defined as any IT resource whose purpose is considered critical to the organization or whose loss or compromise would cause a significant impact on the organization.

Note: Sensitive business/mission service is any business or mission service that needs additional protection from higher-risk IT services based on the nature of the function it provides; sensitivity of the data it consumes, processes, or stores; or criticality to the operation of the organization.

High-value IT resources are the most important and critical IT resources within an organization. They contain the most sensitive data in an organization, perform the most critical tasks of an organization, or have access to and can control all or nearly all IT resources within an organization. Administrator accounts for high-value IT resources must be protected against various threats and attacks because threats to sensitive privileged accounts are high and risk of compromise is increasing. Requiring a DAW used exclusively for remote administrative management of designated high-value IT resources, including servers, workstations, directory services, applications, databases, and network components, will provide a separate "channel" for the performance of administrative tasks on high-value IT resources and isolate these functions from the majority of threats and attack vectors found on higher-risk standard client systems.

Some IT resources, by the nature of the function they perform, should always be considered high value and should be remotely administered only via a DAW. The IT resources listed above are in this category.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

A key security construct of a DAW is to separate administrative accounts into specific trust levels so that an administrator account used to manage an IT resource at one trust level cannot be used to manage IT resources at another trust level. This architecture protects IT resources in a tier from threats from higher-risk tiers. Isolating administrative accounts by forcing them to operate only within their assigned trust zone implements the concept of containment of security risks and adversaries within a specific zone. The Tier model prevents escalation of privilege by restricting what administrators can control and where they can log on.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Note: If using the Microsoft scripts, after running the scripts, DAW Users Tier 0, DAW Users Tier 1, and DAW Users Tier 2 groups may need to be created under Admin/Tier 0/Groups, Admin/Tier 1/Groups, and Admin/Tier 2/Groups, respectively. In addition, some OUs, Groups, and policies with "PAW" in the title will need to be relabeled with "DAW" or other appropriate name.

      <fixtext fixref="F-WDAW-00-002200_fix">Configure the DAW host-based firewall to block outbound connection requests to the Internet gateway or configure the DAW with an Internet proxy address with a loopback address. Allowed exceptions include connections to communicate with IT resources being managed via the DAW, including the management console of authorized public cloud services; with domain controllers; or with a digital credential verification service (for example, Online Certificate Status Protocol [OCSP]).

If the DAW host-based firewall method is used, configure the firewall to block outbound connection requests to the Internet gateway. The exact configuration procedure will depend on which host-based firewall (for example, Host-Based Security System [HBSS]) is used on the DAW.

If the Internet proxy address with a loopback address method is used, consider using the configuration instructions listed in of the Microsoft Privileged Access Workstation paper.

In addition, disable the capability of the administrator to manually override the proxy settings on each DAW.</fixtext>

Ask site personnel how outbound connections from the DAW to the Internet have been blocked. Two common methods are to either configure the host-based firewall to block all outbound connection requests to the Internet gateway or to configure the DAW with an Internet proxy address with a loopback address. Based on the method used at the site, review either the configuration of the host-based firewall or the DAW configuration and verify the configuration blocks all outbound Internet connections except to communicate with IT resources being managed via the DAW, with domain controllers, or with a digital credential verification service (for example, OCSP).

If the site has configured the DAW with a loopback address, verify a proxy server group policy has been set up with a loopback address (127.0.0.1) and assigned to the DAW Users group.

If the DAW system has not been configured to block all outbound connections to the Internet from a DAW except to communicate with IT resources being managed via the DAW, with domain controllers, or with a digital credential verification service, this is a finding.</check-content>

      <title>Restricted remote administration must be enabled for high-value systems.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Restricted remote administration features, RestrictedAdmin mode and Remote Credential Guard for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) are an additional safeguard against "pass the hash" attacks, where hackers attempt to gain higher administrative privileges from a single compromised machine. Restricted remote administration protects administrator accounts by ensuring that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that could potentially be compromised. When restricted remote administration is implemented the local RDP service tries to log in to the remote device using a network logon, so the user’s credentials are not sent across the network. Therefore, if the high-value IT resource is compromised, the credentials of the administrator connecting to the IT resource from the DAW are not compromised.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>
